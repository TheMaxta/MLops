# ML Ops Deployment and Model Training Roadmap

## Learn Technologies:
### General ML Packages:
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit Learn

### Model Analysis Packages:
- ML Flow
- W&B

### Deployment:
- Docker: Build containers for the ML deployment
- Kubernetes: Orchestrate clusters of our ML-based containers

### Fast API:
- Create an API that hooks into an ML model from ML Flow

### Stream Lit:
- Deploy web interface for ML Flow API

## Next Steps:
Expand this guide into a comprehensive explanation of how to use these technologies mentioned. The purpose of this is to be a guide I can use to classify all of this information so that I may deploy models whenever necessary.

## Implementation:
- Implement the basic random forest classifier with Fast API
- Implement a running Streamlit application: run inference on random forest
- Build containers for all of this
- Set up a Kubernetes environment to orchestrate these containers.

## Core Commands:
### MLflow:
- To start the MLflow server: `mlflow ui`
- For tracking experiments: `mlflow track <parameters>`

### Streamlit:
- To run a Streamlit application: `streamlit run app.py`

### Docker:
- Build a Docker image: `docker build -t <image_name> .`
- Run a Docker container: `docker run <image_name>`

### Kubernetes:
- Create a deployment: `kubectl apply -f <deployment_file>.yaml`
- Get deployments: `kubectl get deployments`

## Notes:
These are big steps and big tasks so breaking them up into smaller goals is smart. Understanding that all of this is a very complicated and time-consuming effort is essential.

I will likely be spending the majority of the next couple of days working with Kubernetes and Docker because these are complicated and expansive technologies that will be ever-present in the coming years of my career. This will be time well spent.

## Unrelated Notes:
- Need to start putting time and thought into how to sell my experience and projects
- Need to make updates to my resume and create an AI-focused resume.
- Any time spent considering AI jobs reading through job postings and exploring even potential other positions is a great use of time.
